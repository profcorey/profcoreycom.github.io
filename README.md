Hello everyone! 

My name is Dr. Corey Leong. I teach cloud computing courses and other related courses. I am originally from Honolulu, Hawaii then moved to Englewood, Florida where I grew up before moving to Tampa to attend the University of South Florida. At USF, I earned a BS in Management Information Systems before working in the sports industry. My first IT job was working as a webmaster and system administrator for the entire Minor League Baseball system. After moving on from baseball, I went to work at NBA City at Universal Studios.

From there, I worked at CenturyLink in Winter Park as an enterprise java developer. After a couple of years working at a telecom, I went to work for Oracle as a senior curriculum developer in the Linux and Virtualization area. I then went back to school and attended UCF graduate school earning three master degrees: MNM in nonprofit management, MA in instructional design & technology, and MS in modeling and simulation. I recently finished my doctorate degree at UCF in curriculum and instruction focusing on the impact of cognitive load on cybersecurity usability.

Before joining Valencia as a professor, I did contract work for Google as a writer on the Google cybersecurity certification and was also contracted at IBM to develop content for some of their Coursera courses. I currently live in Orlando with my family. We enjoy attending Orlando Magic basketball games and love to travel and attend wine tasting events.

I look forward to meeting everyone and learning about individual goals and journeys as we begin this semester.

You can contact me using Google Chat, Google Spaces, and Canvas Email lastly.

Work hard, enjoy the journey, and have a great semester!
